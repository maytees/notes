# Industrial Revolution

What is it?

When a society shifts from using hands tools to make products to using new sources of energy (ex:coal) to power MACHINES in factories

Why is it important

- Possibly most profound far-reaching changes in history
    - Lifestyle (life expectancy, income)
    - Urbanization
    - Wealth disparities
    - Imperialism

### Before the Industrial Revolution...

- By mid-1700’s, only 20% of the population lived in cities or towns
- Most families farmed to make money
- Villages shared common farmland - no fences
- Farm life was harsh ex. hard work, low life expectancy, children died young

### Early Industries

- Cottage industries: labor system in which workers produced goods at home
- Benefits:
    - Set own hours and work breaks
    - Whole family contributed (even children)
    - Could still take care of farm and family
    - Provided steady income and stability

## Changes:

- Enclosure Movement:
    
    Wealthy landowners buy up common farmland for their own estates and fence it in
    
    - Begin to use more efficient farming methods
- Result: Villagers lose their land and are no longer needed
    - Move to cities for jobs (growth of cities = urbanization)

## Agricultural Revolution

- With enclosed fields landowners began experimenting with new farming techniques (crop rotation, seeding fertilizing) and crop yields increased
- More food supply directly led to rapid population growth (England and Wales)
    - From 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801
    

## How did countries become industrial

5 ‘factors’ needed to be in place for industrialization to occur

1. Labor (Manpower)
2. Natural Resources (Materials)
3. Capital (Money)
4. Technology (Machines)
5. Consumers (Markets)

The first country to achieve all factors was England!

## Why was England Different

- Labor - They had many people moving to the cities looking for jobs (Enclosure Movement)
- Natural Resources
    - Water power and coal to fuel new machines
    - Iron to build machines, tools and factories
    - Rivers for transportation
    - Harbors for trade
- Strong economy
    - Banking system to provide loans for investments (capital_
    - Growing overseas trade (consumers)
- Political stability
    - People willing to make investments (entrepreneurs)

## Early Industrialization

- Rise of the factory system (technology)
    - An organized method of producing goods that brings workers and machines together under the control of managers
    - Cottage industries decline because new technology is too big
- Rise of classes
    - Industrial capitalists - factory owners
    - Middle class (professionals & managers)
        - better standard of living (variety in food and clothing)
        - Leisure time (demand for entertainment - books, museums, newspapers, concerts, sporting events)
- Huge urban poor
    - Upward movement required education
    - Work life is absolutely awful

## Industrial Production

- Britain= head start!
    - Technology and new machinery boomed
        - Cotton = greatest industry
        - Inventions! Steam engine pushed coal industry
    - British economy supported investments
        - Created monopolies on products .) huge profits → further growth
        - 1900’s, Britain dominates world industry
    - Other countries tried to catch up
        - British is dominant
        - Expensive to get new machinery and technology all at once

# Changes from the Industrial Revolution

## Reforms

- The demands of the industrial revolution were very hard on working class people
- Workers began to insist that changes and reforms be made
- What were the problems?
    - Factory Life
        - Child labor
        - Unsafe conditions
        - Low wages
        - Long hours
        - No ‘benefits’
    - City Life/Living Conditions
        - Crowded housing
        - Unsanitary environment
        - Lack of education
        - Pollution
        - Diseases
        - Poverty
        - Crime
        - No voice for workers
        

## Changes are Coming

- First in the factories to improve the plight of child labor
- Also to be addressed was the inequality for women (they made about 1/2 as much as men)

Women’s groups led the way for reforms by supporting the need for equality and protection for children

## Workers Get Organized!

- Labor Unions: started in the 1800’s
    - Voluntary organizations of workers trying to improve working conditions with one voice
- Workers demanded...
    - Higher pay
    - Shorter work days
    - Safer working conditions
    - Child labor laws
- Lobbied for reforms and laws that would protect their rights

## Union Methods

- Collective Bargaining
    - Negotiations between workers and their employers (ex. higher pay and shorter hours...)
    - Strike: refusal to work until demands met
        - Ex: Factory forced to close, no goods produced/sold and company loses money

## Reforms Made Slowly

Focus started with improvement to working conditions and wages:

- Government regulations passed: to improve health and safety conditions in factories (first attempt: 1902 Factory act)
- Child Labor Laws: to enforced minimum age and hours worked (Factory act of 1833)

## Changes to Society

Slavery:

- Abolished in England (1833)
- United States (1865)

Women’s Suffrage:

(right to vote)

- England: 1918
- 1920

They should not lower the legal working age because it will make no difference as kids in poor countries will still be forced to work to make money for their families. 

Arguments:

- Poor families will not be able to make the amount needed

## How do we get to industrial capitalism

Economic system: factors of productions (everything that goes into making something) are privately owned and money (capital) is invested o make a profit - government is limited

- Market (supply and demand) creates best possible economic situation (true for goods and services, including labor)

## Adam Smith - Father of Modern Capitalism

- Wrote: The Wealth of Nations, 1776
- Competition and people’s choice drove markets
    - Specialization of labor

## Competition

- “Invisible Hand” - competition forces companies to make better products w/better prices (same for wages)

## Positive Impact

- Standard of living for middle class got a lot better
    - New products made life easier (cards, telephones, washing machines, trains)

- Factories and assembly lines increased amount of products that could be made and made them cheaper (Ford Model T)

## Impact

- Owners had a lot of control over lives
- Competition led to mine and factory owners to keep costs of production low and profits high
- Monopolies eventually formed which led to:
    - Low wages
    - Longer hours, few breaks
    - Fewer safety measures
    - More women and children working

## Socialism

- Many saw injustices of capitalism
- Believed that government should plan economy (not supply and demand)
    - Government should decide what to make and how much, then should provide for the people
    - Socialism - most factors of production are owned by the government and operate for the welfare of all

### Karl Marx

- Believed in a racial form of socialism - Marxism
- Wrote Communist Manifesto
- Believed that society was divided
    - Bourgeoisie are the middle class
    - VS Proletariat which are the workers
    - Believed that the Proletariat would overthrow the Bourgeoisie
    - Workers would take control of factories/mills and redistribute wealth equally among the people
    - No private property
    - Society would cooperate and work for the good of ALL
- Marx’s idea was that Communism is the final stage of socialism
- Pure Communism
    - Means that the production of *things* are owned by the people as a whole
    - All goods and services are shared equally
