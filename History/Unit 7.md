- 300 million workers..
    - Supplied raw materials (cotton, indigo, opium)

    - Most famous member  Mohandas Gandhi (Nonviolent methods to oppose British Rule in India)

## Impacts of Industrial Colonization (Positive?)

- British build the world’s third railroad system in India

## The “Scramble for Africa” began around 1880

- A few European countries had already started to claim land throughout Africa

- The colony was not owned by the country of Belgium, but his personal property
- The territory was hugely wealthy in mineral deposits like gold, silver, copper, and cobalt
- The most valuable resource in the late 1800’s in the Congo was rubber. Villages were required to bring a certain amount of Rubber to Belgian traders and if they did not they would have their hands cut off.
- Treatment of natives was so harsh it is estimated that 50 percent of the population died in about a ten year period after 1885 (over ten million people)
- Protest from European reporters, church groups and socijal groups eventually persuaded the other countries in Europe to force Leopold to give the Congo to the country of Belgium
- The Congo would gain independence in 1960
