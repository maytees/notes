# Unit 2

### Atlantic slave trade:

*Effect of Slave Trade -*

**On Africa**

- Cultures lost generations of their young men and women
- Introduction to guns to tribal warfare

**On Americas**

- Key to European economic success
    - Many colonies would not have survived without their forced labor
- Africans brought their culture and expertise (agriculture)
- Residual effects of racism today (yikes)

---

*Race Encoded Into Law -*

- The Virginia law in 1662 that decreed that the status of the child followed the status of the mother, which meant that enslaved women gave birth to generations of children of Africa descent who were now seen as commodities
    - The 13 colonies became a slave ***nation*** which will become the U.S.A later on.
    - The law secured wealth for European colonists and generations of their descendants even as free black people could be legally prohibited from leaving their wealth to their children.
    - Racial class hierarchies were being coded into law.
    

*Liberation Theology -*

- In 1831, Nat Turner, along with about 70 enslaved and free black people led a revolt Southampton County, VA, that shook the nation.
- Nat Turner was a preacher (a priest)
- Nat planned the uprise for months, through a solar eclipse, which he thought was a sign from god
- Over 2 days, they killed over 60 people before being overtaken by the state militia (a military from the people)
- Turner went into hiding but he was found and hung a few months later.
- One of the deadliest revolts during slavery, a powerful act of resistance that left enslavers scared for their lives and loss of property ðŸ˜‚
- A Virginia resident by the name of Elanor Weaver sent a letter to her family members saying, "We hope our government will take some steps to put down negro preaching. It is those large assemblies of Negroes causing the mischief." meaning that she did not like African Americans being priests.
- More strict laws came to make lives of black people, either free or enslaved, harder than ever, limiting their ability to read, write, and much more.

*Continual Resistance -*

- In Sep 1739, a group of enslaved Africans in South Carolina colony, led by an enslavement called Jemmy, gathered outside Charleston, where they killed two storekeepers and seized weapons and amination.
- White lawmakers in South Carolina, afraid of additional rebellions put a 10-year temporary stop on the importation of enslaved Africans and passed the Negro Act of 1740, which criminalized assembly, education and moving abroad among the enslaved.
