# World War 1

## Prussian Nationalism

Debates rages over whether Austria would be incorporated into a new Germany

## Cultural Influences

Brother Grimm: Collected “German” folktales hat were free of foreign influences

Richard Wagner: Composed operas about German mythology

Romantic Artists (Emotional): Created paintings

## Economic Unification

Under the Holy Roman Empire there were 1800 customs barriers

Goods shipped from Konigsberg to Cologne would be taxed 80 times

Prussia custom union: no taxes between German states; high taxes on imports from abroad

Railroads connect German state

## Prussian Leadership-King Wilhelm The First

Conservative politically

Lifelong goal was to create a united Germany under Prussian leadership

Realpolitik: Diplomacy based on what is practical rather than morals and ideology

- Conservative Values:  Believed in monarchy, opposed democracy
- Liberal Values: Created health, accident and disability insurance for workers, old age pensions

Tried to prevent alliance between Russia, France and Britain

### Using War to build German Unity-Denmark Edition

Bismarck wanted a common enemy to bind together different German states

Bismarck built up anger against Denmark over their treatment of German speaking regions

Prussia led an alliance of German states (including Austria) to “Protect against external aggression”

### Using War to build German Unity-Austria Edition

Bismarck wanted to eliminate Austrian influence over the other states of Germany

Prussia made a secret alliance with part of Italy to oppose Austria

Prussia’s armies crushed Austria, gaining lots of new territory

Prussia created a North German Confederation

### Using War to build German Unity-France Edition

Used dispute over Spanish throne to make France an enemy

Bismarck knew a war against France would force the German state to work together 

Bismarck edited and then published a telegram from Wilhelm I to Napoleon III, insulting France

France attacked Prussia

German states joined to defend themselves and Prussia

## Franco-Prussian War

German armies were better led, equipped and supplied (railroads!)

Prussia defeated French armies, capturing Napoleon III and surrounding Paris

1871 In the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles Wilhelm I was proclaimed Kaiser (Emperor) of Germany

France was forced to surrender and pay a huge indemnity, and surrender German speaking territories of Alsace and Lorraine

## Aftermath of Franco-Prussian War

A unified Germany was the most powerful country in Europe - Upsetting the balance of power from the Congress of Vienna

France desperately wanted revenge on Germany for their humiliating loss

In WW1 France would demand the return of Alsace and Lorraine

## Causes of World War I

The World War I did not have just one cause, it had many such as Imperial Rivalry (materials, markets, territory), Nationalism, Arms Race, Tight Alliances, and Diplomatic Missteps

## Mobilization

- It took time for each country to move the huge numbers of soldiers weapons, supplies, and pack animals to the front
- Extensive plans has to be created to move the railroads, each bullet had to be accounted for.

## Tangled Alliances

The triple alliance

- The triple alliance consisted of Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy
    - Wilhelm II built a navy (Britain felt threatened; Russia also felt threatened

Triple Entente

- The Triple Entente consisted of Russia, France, and Great Britain
    - Britain not obligated to fight for France and Russia but will not fight against them
    - Britain promised to defend Belgium’s “neutrality”

## Things Heat Up in the Balkan Region

- Austria Hungary is having a hard time with its ethnic groups
    - Serbia, a neighboring country, wanted all Slavic peoples (including those in Austro Hungarian Empire) to unite in one Slavic country (Kind of like what Prussia did with Germany)

## Black Hand

The Black Hand was a secret Serbian society committed to riding Bosnia of Austrian rule began plotting. Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro Hungarian Empire planned to make Austria Hungary a triple alliance; the black hand does not want them to do this, they want them to become a part of Serbia. Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo (June 28, 1914)

## Germany’s “Blank Check” to Austria

Before Austria Hungary gave its ultimatum to Serbia, Germany told them that they would back them and defend them against any war involving Russia

Austria Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia (July 23, 1914) Which was very harsh :)

## Schlieffen Plan

- Germany thought that it would take Russia 6 weeks to mobilize
- Believed they could knock out France in 3 months
- The only plan that Germany could use
- Germany attacks through Belgium avoiding French defenses
- The armies would create a great wheel that encircled Paris
- It relied on speed and decisive force
- Initially a huge success Germans get within miles of Paris

## Race to the Sea

- Each side worried that would be outflanked and encircled
- They began to build leapfrog each other on an attempt to get to the sea
- Western Front
    - Each side dug trenches that stretched from the Atlantic

## World War I

- Japan joined British side in august 1914
- Ottoman Empire joined German side in November 1914

## Eastern Front

While Germany was invading France on the Western Front, they only had a small army in in the Eastern Front, leaving Russia to come through. Russian generals competed rather than working together and tier armies were destroyed. German army crushed Russian at the Battle of Tannenberg. Russian army was revealed to still be very outdated and poorly supplied. German generals were divided if the best way to win the war is attacking France or Russia

## Somme Battle:

In the Somme battle with the British vs the Germans, the British sent thousands of airstrikes onto the enemy earning them a mile in advance but killed over 58k soldiers in the first day!

## The role of colonies

- Helped out the mother countries throughout the war
- They hoped to gain independence after the war

## Total War

Countries devoted all resources to war effort

- Even those on the “Homefront” felt pressures of war
- Hard on civilians when no progress was being made
- Main Point: Every civilian  contributed to the war, meaning that they are a viable target

## How does the US join the war?

- Wanted to stay “neutral”, but chose to assist the Allies
- Because the US sent supplies to Europe, Germany started “unrestricted submarine warfare”
    - Submarines would sink any ship in waters around Great Britain **without warning**.
- Lusitania - (1915) British passenger ship sunk by German U-boats; many Americans on board.. sooo, you know what happens.

## Zimmerman Telegram January 1917

- Telegram sent by Germany to Mexico, intercepted by Britain
- Germany promised to help Mexico reconquer the Southwest if they would attack the U.S
- Final straw for the US
    - Declared war on Germany a few days later

## End of the War

- Entrance of the US tipped the war in favor of the Allies

But then...

- Russia withdrew from war because of huge revolution (first communist revolution) back home
- Central powers weakened by fighting
    - Surrendered one by one

## The “Forgotten Genocide”

Prior to WW1,there were 2 million Armenians in Ottoman Empire

By 1922, there were fewer than 400000.

## Paris Peace Conference

representatives from over a dozen countries met at the palace of Versailles 

Russia did not attend because they had already left the war and they were in the middle of a Civil War

Germany and it’s allies were not allowed to negotiate terms

- Wilson came to meeting w/plan for peace called the “Fourteen Points”
    - Called for end to secret treaties - countries would think twice before going to war
    - Allowed free trade - dependent countries
    - Reduced militaries -
- Change borders and create new countries to allow for nationalism (and self determination)

Wilson also wanted a League of Nations, which is an international organization whose goal was to keep peace and prevent future wars

Great Britain and France did not agree with most of Wilson’s plan. They were concerned with national security and wanted to strip Germany of all power; they wanted to punish Germany.

## “Mandate System” in the former Ottoman Empire → Gave Great Britain and France control over these territories

- French took:
    - Syria and Lebanon
- British Controlled:
    - Iraq
    - Transjordan,
    - Palestine

## After treaty of Versailles:

United States did not agree to the Treaty of Versailles and refused to sign it. Didn’t like idea of League of Nations (concerned it would force them to get involved in future European conflicts)

Germans were very angry and bitter about the Treaty of Versailles → Resentment and hatred of the Allies

African and Asian colonies felt cheated that they did not gain any rights or independence

Europe talked a lot about nationalism, but didn’t apply it to the colonies.

Japan and Italy joined the war to gain new territories, though they did not gain as much as they hoped

## Pre-Revolutionary Russia

- Nicholas II Tsar (Absolute ruler)
    - He was not a bad leader, but he was sometimes brutal to people
    - Secret police used to silence people who go against him

## Life in Russia

- Landless peasants who had no possibility of rising
- No representative government
- Harsh conditions
- Life progressively difficult as Russia industrializes
- When WWI starts, things get even worse
    - Russia gets food & fuel shortages

## Marxists Seek Change

- Supporters of Karl Marx’s philosophy grew in Russia
    - Believed that the proletarian (worker peasants) would overthrow the czar
    - Workers would form “dictatorship of the proletarian” (workers → rule the country)
    
    ### Marxists With Different Strategies
    
    - Split into two groups
        - Mensheviks - More moderate, and wanted a more broad base of support
        - Bolsheviks - More radical, they supported small number of committed revolutionaries willing to sacrifice
            - Vladimir LENIN was the leader, he fled to Western Europe to avoid getting arrested by the Russian Czar; he eventually become known as the “Father of the Revolution”

## Russia under the Czar

- Nicholas the Second - Considered incompetent
- Lost Russo-Japanese War
- Rasputin - “Mystical Healer” (made leaders look foolish)
- World War I
    - Total war
    - Low morale
    - People wanted to get out of the war

## Provisional Government

- Provisional = “Temporary” government
    - Kept fighting in WWI to support allies
    - Conditions worsen
    - Peasants demand land
    - Workers increasingly radical
- The provisional Government did not have as much power as the Soviets (local councils of workers, peasants, and soldiers)
    
    ### Mistakes of the provisional Government
    
    - Biggest mistake = kept Russia in WW1
    - 

 

## The March 1917 Revolution

- 200,000 workers march on St. Petersburg over bread and fuel shortages
- Czars soldiers eventually joined the revolution

## Vladimir Lenin

- Bolshevik / Communist Revolutionary
- Living in Switzerland
- Sent back to Russia by Germany
    - Germans hoped that Lenin would create revolutions and destabilize the country
- Promised peace, an immediate end to the fighting in WWI, land - taking away land from nobles and giving to the peasants, and bread - food for the starved cities
    
    ### Leon Trotsky
    
    - Lenin’s right hand man
    - Created the Red Army - Communist armies
    
    ### October Revolutions - 1917
    
    - Provisional government was weak
    - Time was ripe for a takeover
    - Ordered “Red Guard” to arrest provisional government and take over
    
    ### Constituent Assembly
    
    - Lenin tried to create a democratic body to rule the country
    - His party lost the elections and were a minority
    - Trotsky wrote that only 25,000 - 30,000 workers and soldiers participated in the revolution in the Petrograd, only 5% of the population
    - Lenin closed the Assembly after just one meeting
    - Supporters of the Assembly were shot when they tried to protest its dismissal
    - Bolsheviks gave huge amounts territory to Central powers in order to gain peace
    - Unpopular amongst many Russians
    
    ### Civil War 1917-21
    
    - Reds - Take control of St. Petersburg and Moscow
    - Whites - Opponents of communism but not unified
    - Greens - Local groups protecting their land
    - Allied countries including Britain, France, and the US to try and overthrow the Bolsheviks
    - This helped build support for the Bolsheviks
        
        ### Bolshevik Victory!
        
        - Whites too disorganized to work together
        - Bolsheviks controlled key cities and industries

## Death of Czar-July 17, 1918

- Czar Nicholas II was considered a dangerous symbol for opposition to the Bolsheviks
- The Czar and his family were gathered together in the basement of the home they were imprisoned in and executed by their Bolshevik guards.

## Stalin

- Lenin would be replaced as the leader of the Soviet Union by Stalin
- Stalin would purge millions of Soviet citizens in order to consolidate his rule

## Another war? Yes.
[[Interwar Years, Great Depression, and WW2]]
