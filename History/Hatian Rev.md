# Unit 5

# Haitian Revolution:

# Haiti's population had competing goals

- Four Groups in Haitian Society
    - Big whites - wanted to maintain slavery and gain more independence for Haiti *(Saint Domingue is what it was called back then)*
    - Free People of Color ( FPC) - wanted equal rights to whites and to maintain their position
    - Little Whites - wanted to deny full rights to Free People of Color in order to remain "superior"; they were Europeans living in Haiti
    - Enslaved People - initially only wanted better working conditions, but would later demand full abolition of slavery; prisoners of war

## French Revolution's early impact on Haiti

Haiti's population was divided: Support monarch? Support revolutionaries? Try for independence?

Declaration of the Rights of Man caused divisions in Haiti

- Who was guaranteed rights? Whites? Freed People of Color?
- Was slavery outlawed? Or was owning slaves protected as property

Was Haiti better off as French colony?

Should enslaved people ally with France's enemies like Britain and Spain?

## Early Revolution Summer 1791

While the other factions of society bickered, a secret network of enslaved persons("rebels") launched a revolt*

- Plantations, fields were burned; many whites were killed; freed slaves as they went
- Rebel leaders traded for weapons with Spanish

Haitian rebels wanted more days off to work their own land and to outlaw use of the whip

- White plantation owners refused
- Rebel armies then demanded total abolition; controlled countryside

Eventually, FPC launched their own insurrection to assert their equal rights with whites

## War in Europe came to Haiti

IN 1792, French troops had gained control of Haiti but radical French government passed law granting equal rights to Free People of Color

- Big Whites opposed but did not prevent this
- French colony government and FPC worked to fight extremist whites and slave rebellion

Then things got more complicated

Following creation of French republic and execution of Louis XVI; Spain and England invaded Haiti to conquer the rich colony and prevent the spread of slave rebellion to their colonies

Rebel leaders like Toussaint Louverture allied with Spanish against the French Plantation owners

## Quick Summary of What Happened:

Four Groups

- Big whites - Not supported by anyone, blacks hate them, whether slave or free, French Revolutionary government hates them as they oppose Rights of Man, only supporters are other slave holders, like the British or Spanish
- Free People of Color - Supported by most people of France; also encouraged by Robspierre
- Little Whites - Caught in the middle, not inclined to support slaves, but like the ideas of the Revolution, not likely to support British or Spanish
- Slaves - Want freedom - But who will give it? will the promise be kept?

## Toussaint Louverture rose to power

Toussaint Louverture = Free Person of Color (former slave)

- Before the revolution he owned a plantation, with enslaved persons
- Initially supported reforms to slavery, but after Big Whites refused to compromise he fought for abolition

During the rebellion, Louverture allied with Spanish, became respected general

- Switched sides when France (1794) abolished slavery in Caribbean colonies
- Best organized and effective military unit (tipped war in favor of French)

## Louverture as revolutionary leader

Loverture because Lt. General and commander in chief of army in Haiti

- Defeated British

Louverture, with the support of the US won a civil war against a rival rebel leader

- Louverture because most powerful person in Haiti (de facto ruler)
- 1801 new Haitian constitution abolished slavery across island
- Technically, Haiti was still a French colony but it was autonomous
- His goals:
    
    
    - End Slavery in Haiti
    - Make Haiti Autonomous (make their own decisions)
    - Be the sole ruler of the country

## Napoleon gained power; Haiti's uncertain future

Louverture debated how best to secure Haiti's future

- Should Haiti declare independence or remain a colony of France
- Should the newly freed slaves take over the land and make their own farms, or would Haiti need money from the plantations to survive

## 1801, Louverture issued a new constitution that completely abolish slavery

- The pros
    - All citizens have equal rights, no more slavery
- The cons
    - Outlawed Vodou (in favor of Catholicism)
    - Continued plantations system (large estates only)
    - Required farm labor (although paid)
    - Army enforced rule (Louverture = Governor general for life)

## Louverture faced opposition

- Former Enslaved
    - Louverture's policies seemed like slavery by another name
    - Farm workers rose up in October 1801 for distribution of land, called for extermination of French whites and indeendece
    - Louverture put down rebellion but opposition grew
- Napoleon
    - Upset over colony's seeming autonomy; desire to reinstitute slavery
    - Sent 20,000 troops to take Saint Domingue (Oct, 1801)

## War of Independence

- How'd it go at first?
    - Many of Louverture soldiers joined French because they saw themselves as citizens and they didn't know slavery would be reinstututed
    - Louverture negotiated and then was captured
- And for the French?
    - Horrible, tropical diseases killed HUGE numbers (with in three months, lost 1/3 of troops)
    - Guerilla warfare dragged out conflict because former enslaved and maroons wouldn't stop
- Then what?
    - More islanders joined revolt; Louverture's soldiers joined resistance
    - French used horrific violence to try to quell it (backfired)
    - Haitian general Dessalines took leadership of rebels
    - Scorched earth tactics - burning everything behind so there are no supplies left where France invades, same thing as Russia

## Not worth the cost...

By mid 1803, fight in Saint Domingue had weakened French army

- Lost ~ 30K French troops! (maybe ~150k islanders died)
- French and Americans agreed on Louisiana Purchase (symbolic of Napoleon giving up on Western Hemisphere)

## Haiti's Independence

- 1804, General Dessalines proclaimed Saint Domingue's independence from France and the new country of Haiti
    - 1st nation of former slaves
- After the revolution:
    - Dessalines ordered slaughter of remaining French
        - Crowned emperor; ratified constitution
        - All Haitians free and equal and had inalienable right to land ownership

## Fear of Haitian Example

France  successfully lobbied countries to isolate Haiti

Haiti forced to agree to disadvantageous trade agreements

Haiti had to pay reparations to France

## Development in Haiti Hampered

Terrible trade deals; reparations (1913, 80% of income used to pay debt); high interest loads

Major obstacles to developing industry to rebuild economy

Infrastructure had been wrecked (scorched earth, destroy connections to slavery)

## Example of Liberation

Provided freedom and dignity; right to land

- Revolt inspired oppressed throughout Caribbean
- Other countries restricted immigration from Haiti to limit stpread of ideas
- Haitian's invited anyone escaping slavery to Haiti
- Abolitionists and anti abolitionist used Haiti as example

## Long Lasting Impact

Success of Haiti's fight against France convinced Napoleon to sell Louisiana (strengthened US; grew slavery there)

Haiti decline as one of the richest colonies to one of the most impoverished countries

Sugar production (and slavery) grew elsewhere to replace Haiti
